# GrimmsKiste/GrimmsBox - storytelling box
The so called "GrimmsBox" was a project by students at the Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart, Germany. We used a common receipt printer to print out the first part of a story. At the end of the part a decision needs to be made. Using buttons you can choose how the story shall go on. We used a Raspberry Pi to run the software.

The boxes are now in use at the public library Mannheim. They use them for the promotion of reading and writing abilities. The immersive reading experience and the stories written by children for children shall get children from grades 3 to 6 into reading.

There is an instructable on how to build the box, install the code and use it: https://www.instructables.com/id/GrimmsBox-Build-Your-Own-Storytelling-Device/
